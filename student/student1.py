def student_entrypoint(client_message: ClientMessage):
	"""
	Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to build an algorithm for chunk bitrate selection that provides
	the best possible experience for users streaming from your service.

	Construct an algorithm below that selects a quality for a new chunk given the parameters in ClientMessage. Feel
	free to create any helper function, variables, or classes as you wish.

	Simulation does ~NOT~ run in real time. The code you write can be as slow and complicated as you wish without
	penalizing your results. Focus on picking good qualities!

	Also remember the config files are built for one particular client. You can (and should!) adjust the QoE metrics to
	see how it impacts the final user score. How do algorithms work with a client that really hates rebuffering? What
	about when the client doesn't care about variation? For what QoE coefficients does your algorithm work best, and
	for what coefficients does it fail?

	Args:
		client_message : ClientMessage holding the parameters for this chunk and current client state.

	:return: float Your quality choice. Must be one in the range [0 ... quality_levels - 1] inclusive.
	"""
	return 0  # Let's see what happens if we select the lowest bitrate every time
